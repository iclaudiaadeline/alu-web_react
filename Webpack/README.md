Webpack Module - Learning Path
A comprehensive learning module covering Webpack 5 fundamentals, progressing from basic setup to advanced modular architecture with development servers and code splitting.

Module Overview
This module contains four progressive tasks that teach Webpack concepts, starting with simple bundling and advancing to modular applications with dev-server support. Each task builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts and features.

Learning Progression
task_0: Basic Webpack setup without custom configuration
task_1: Custom webpack.config.js with production build optimization
task_2: CSS and image asset handling with loaders and optimization
task_3: Development server, modular architecture, and code splitting
Quick Start
Each task has its own installation and build process. Start with task_0 and progress sequentially.

# Navigate to a task directory
cd Webpack/task_X

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start dev server (task_3 only)
npm run start-dev

Task Descriptions
Task 0: Basic Setup
Goal: Learn basic Webpack without custom configuration

Key Features:

Default Webpack behavior (entry: src/index.js, output: dist/main.js)
jQuery dependency
HTML file in dist/ directory
Simple DOM manipulation
Build Command: npm run build Output: dist/main.js (85.3 KiB)

Task 1: Custom Configuration
Goal: Create custom webpack.config.js and learn bundling with configuration

Key Features:

Custom entry point: js/dashboard_main.js
Custom output path: public/bundle.js
Production mode optimization
Lodash debounce for event handling
Counter dashboard with 5 DOM elements
Build Command: npm run build Output: public/bundle.js (88.2 KiB)

Key Technologies:

ts-loader: TypeScript compilation
Webpack 5 production mode
Task 2: CSS and Images
Goal: Learn asset handling with CSS and image loaders

Key Features:

style-loader and css-loader for CSS import
file-loader and image-webpack-loader for image optimization
Background image styling
Counter display with custom CSS
Build Command: npm run build Output: public/bundle.js (93.2 KiB) + optimized image asset

Key Technologies:

style-loader: Inject CSS into DOM
css-loader: Parse CSS imports
file-loader: Handle static assets
image-webpack-loader: Optimize images (JPEG compression)
Task 3: Dev Server and Modules
Goal: Learn development workflow with webpack-dev-server and code splitting

Key Features:

webpack-dev-server on port 8564

Tips and Best Practices
Install Dependencies First: Always run npm install before building to ensure all packages are available.

Clean Builds: If you encounter issues, delete node_modules/, dist/, and public/ directories, then reinstall and rebuild.

Dev Server Port: Task 3 uses port 8564. Ensure it's not in use before starting the dev server.

TypeScript Compilation: TypeScript errors won't prevent bundling; check console for compilation warnings.

Image Assets: Ensure image files are present in the assets/ directory before building task_2 and task_3.

Troubleshooting
Build Fails with "Cannot find module"
Run npm install to ensure all dependencies are installed
Check that you're in the correct task directory
Dev Server Won't Start (Task 3)
Ensure port 8564 is not in use
Run npm run build first to generate bundles
Check Node.js version compatibility (Node 14+ recommended)
Image Not Loading
Verify assets/holberton-logo.jpg exists
Rebuild with npm run build
Check browser console for asset path errors
CSS Not Applying
Ensure CSS is imported in the JavaScript file
Rebuild and hard-refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
Check for CSS loader configuration in webpack.config.js

Next Steps
Complete each task in order: task_0 → task_1 → task_2 → task_3
Read the individual task README.md files for detailed instructions
Experiment with modifying webpack.config.js to understand configuration options
Try adding new modules and entry points in task_3
Integrate with the TypeScript module for advanced type-safe bundling
